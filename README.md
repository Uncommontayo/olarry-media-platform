# O'larry

This repository now keeps the React + Vite frontend inside the `frontend/` directory.

## Quick start
1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev (opens at http://localhost:5174 by default)

## Structure
- frontend/ — React app, Vite config, screenshots, Playwright E2E stub

The backend API is hosted separately; update `API_PROXY_TARGET` in `frontend/vite.config.js` if you point to a different backend.
